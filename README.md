# 📐 Formula Renderer

A lightweight Flask web app that takes the **name of a mathematical formula**, queries the **Ollama model (gemma3:4b)**, and returns the **LaTeX representation** of the formula. The result is displayed both as raw LaTeX and as a beautifully rendered formula using MathJax.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Input a formula name (e.g., *Quadratic Formula*).
- Model responds with JSON containing the LaTeX expression.
- App extracts and displays:
  - Raw LaTeX
  - Rendered formula
- Debug-friendly: saves raw model output to `gemma_raw_response.txt`.
